    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It recursively splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each level, creating a tree-like structure of decisions. Each node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the predicted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Inner Workings of a Decision Tree:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choosing the Best Split:\n",
    "At each node, the algorithm chooses the feature that provides the best split. The \"best\" split is typically determined by maximizing information gain (for classification) or minimizing variance (for regression).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - ***Information Gain***: Measures the reduction in uncertainty about the target variable.\n",
    "    - ***Variance***: Measures the homogeneity of the target variable in a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recursive Splitting:\n",
    "    - The chosen feature is used to split the data into subsets. This process is repeated recursively for each subset until a stopping condition is met.\n",
    "    - Stopping conditions may include reaching a maximum depth, having a minimum number of samples in a node, or achieving perfect purity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Leaf Nodes and Predictions:\n",
    "    - For classification, the majority class in the leaf node is the predicted class.\n",
    "    - For regression, the mean or median of the target values in the leaf node is the predicted value."

    "### Matrix factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization is a technique used in linear algebra and machine learning to decompose a matrix into the product of two or more matrices. The goal is to approximate the original matrix by representing it in a lower-dimensional form. This approach is particularly useful for various applications, including collaborative filtering in recommendation systems and latent factor analysis."

    "In collaborative filtering, users and items are represented by matrices, and matrix factorization helps discover latent factors (features) that capture user preferences and item characteristics.\n",

    "Image and Signal Processing:Matrix factorization is used for tasks like image compression and denoising, where the original data matrix is decomposed into lower-rank approximations.\n",
